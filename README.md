üöÄ Installation
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed (version 3.x.x or higher recommended)

Dart SDK

Firebase CLI installed and configured

Google Cloud Project with Billing Enabled (for Google Maps API Key and Firebase)

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lnmiit-campus-app.git
cd lnmiit-campus-app

2. Install Dependencies
flutter pub get

3. Firebase Setup
Create a Firebase Project: Go to Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add Android/iOS Apps: Follow the Firebase instructions to add Android and iOS apps to your project. This will involve downloading google-services.json (for Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (for iOS) and placing them in the correct directories.

Enable Services:

Authentication: Enable "Email/Password" provider.

Firestore Database: Create a new Firestore database.

Cloud Storage: Enable Cloud Storage.

Firebase Rules: Configure your Firestore and Storage security rules to allow read/write access for authenticated users (or as per your security requirements).

4. Google Maps API Key Setup
Get API Key: Go to Google Cloud Console and create an API key. Enable the following APIs for your project:

Maps SDK for Android

Maps SDK for iOS

Geocoding API

Android Setup:

Open android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.

Add your API key inside the <application> tag:

<meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"/>

Ensure minSdkVersion in android/app/build.gradle is at least 20 (or higher as required by google_maps_flutter).

iOS Setup:

Open ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift (or AppDelegate.m).

Add the following line before GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self):

GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")

Add privacy descriptions to ios/Runner/Info.plist:

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your location when open to show your position on the map and find places near you.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to your location in the background for continuous tracking (if needed by other features).</string>

5. Groq API Key Setup
Get API Key: Sign up for a free API key at Groq.

Update Code: In lib/homepage/pages/ai_chatbot.dart, replace the placeholder _groqApiKey with your actual Groq API key:

static const String _groqApiKey = 'YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE';

Note: Hardcoding API keys directly in client-side code is not recommended for production apps due to security risks. For a real application, consider using environment variables, a server-side proxy, or Firebase Functions to manage API keys securely.
